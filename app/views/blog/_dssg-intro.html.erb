<h3>Introduction to DSSG - July 05, 2014</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
I'm spending this summer as a fellow at the
<%= link_to "Data Science for Social Good", "http://dssg.io" %>
summer fellowship through the University of Chicago Urban Center for
Computation and Data. We've been at it for just over a month now, and now seems
like a good time to do a round up of my thoughts. I'll do a brief overview of
the program and then jump right into the nitty gritty learnings.
</p>
<p>
The staff at DSSG (@rayidghani, @mattgee, ...) have done
an excellent job both of rounding up non-profits with interesting datasets and
of finding data scientists to work with them. The twelve projects were selected
from a large pool of possibilities for three qualities in particular: the
significance of the problems they posed, the quality of their datasets, and the
likelihood that an effective solution to their problem could be found using the
techniques available to data science.
</p>
<p>
A similarly heroic effort was needed to select a group of fellows. Fellows were
chosen as much for their desire to do social good as they were for their
ability to execute, and this jives with the primary purposes of the fellowship,
which are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Do social good.</li>
  <li>Learn.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
We're here to solve tough, meaningful problems with real-world, messy data. But
it's tough to overemphasize the importance of that <i>learning</i> part. With
twelve teams operating in parallel on these problems and sharing resources,
some common challenges have begun to emerge. One of my main personal goals for
the fellowship has been to discover which problems plague data scientists and
to learn ways to handle them. (Stay tuned for a more general version of this
painpoint searching.)
</p>
<p>
These are some of the main problems I've observed and encountered:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The data doesn't match the problem. (Also: There's too little data.)
  <ul>
    <li>More accurately: data is related but not predictive.</li>
    <li>Not enough of the right kind of data.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The data is messy.
  <ul>
    <li>Inconsistent labeling.</li>
    <li>Comes from multiple sources.</li>
    <li>Missing.</li>
    <li>Inaccurate.</li>
    <li>Misleading.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There's too much data.
  <ul>
    <li>Doesn't fit in memory.</li>
    <li>Difficult to decide how to subsample it.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are privacy restrictions on the data.
  <ul>
    <li>Corporations don't want their trade secrets made public.</li>
    <li>Individuals don't want personal information made public.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Most of the data problems seem to fall into one of categories above. This is
just my best guess, though, and I'll do a bit of digging next week to see if
people agree.
</p>
<p>
Each of these problems deserves more attention than this, but here they are.
I'll try to keep adding to the list as I see more patterns emerging.
