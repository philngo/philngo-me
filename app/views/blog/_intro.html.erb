<h3>Why a blog, why now? - June 29,2014</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
About a month ago, I walked up onto a stage wearing a funny hat and paused for
a moment holding a remarkably large red folder in one hand and grasping a hand
much older and wiser than mine in the other. Dad took my picture and I walked
off the stage having officially graduated from college.
</p>
<p>
I had done something similar once before as I finished high school. That time,
I remember wondering why they called it "commencement" when it was so clear
that the purpose of the event was that I was finishing, not beginning. Well, it
feels like a beginning this time.
</p>
<p>
As I commence again, my path is not laid out before me in a way that
I feel I can predict. Perhaps one of the reasons I am writing this blog arises
from a Hansel-and-Gretel-like desire to mark my path so that as things start to
move quickly, I'll know where I came from and what I was learning along the
way. That's not the whole story though. (After all, those bread-crumbs weren't
terribly helpful.)
</p>
<p>
Additionally, I hope to glean some actual learning in the process of writing
down my thoughts and insights. In pursuit of that mostly selfish goal, I don't
plan to enforce much of structure on the posts other than this: that I learn
something in the process of writing and sharing each.

Here goes!
